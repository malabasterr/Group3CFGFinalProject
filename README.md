## Game Overview
"It's Not You, It's Me!" is an interactive 2-player game, allowing users to connect across two different devices. The game asks a series of questions about the players, and the goal is to match responses to earn points. The game is designed for entertainment, connecting friends and families in an engaging quiz format.

## Getting Started
### Helpful Tips
The 'client' folder stores the frontend React code. The 'server' folder contains the backend Node (Express) code. The Project Documentation file contains the PDF of our project documentation report.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Open a new terminal and navigate to the server folder with 
    `cd server`. Then run the server with 
    `nodemon index.js`.
4. Open a new terminal and navigate to the client folder with 
    `cd client`. Then run the development server with
    `npm start`.

When you’re finished, stop the development server. To do so, open both terminals and type `ctrl + C` for windows or `cmd + C` for Mac. If it says “Terminate batch job (Y/N)?" type Y and press enter.

### How to Play
1. Open the game's homepage in a web browser.
2. Explore the About Us and How to Play sections of the homepage, to understand more about the background of the application and game mechanics.
3. Create a new account using the Sign Up button located on the navbar.
4. With the created username and password, Log in with the "Log in to Play" box.
7. Click "Start Game".
8. Share the provided link with a friend to invite them to play.
9. Wait for your friend to join the game *(while the development server is running on localhost, a second player will need to be simulated by opening up a browser in incognito mode, and pasting the link into this to act as player 2's browser)*.
10. Once both players are in the virtual 'room', the game will load.
11. Select answers to 10 questions regarding each player's likelihood to perform certain actions.
12. Earn a point for each matching response.
13. Progress through the questions using the "Next Question" button.
